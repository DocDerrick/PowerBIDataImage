# PowerBI Data Image
This is a databound image control for PowerBI. It's used to display a single image on a report, bound to whatever data field you choose.

With the standard PowerBI visualization you can only display images within other controls like Tables, which limits the size and display options of images.  This custom visualization is ideal for use on detail pages and other pages that highlight a single data record.
