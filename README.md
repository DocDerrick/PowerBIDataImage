# PowerBI Data Image
This is a databound image control for Power BI. It's used to display a single image on a report, bound to whatever data field you choose. The data field should be in the form of a url to an image file.

With the standard Power BI visualization you can only display images within other controls like tables, which limits the size and display options of the images.  This custom visualization is ideal for use on detail pages and other pages that highlight a single data record.
